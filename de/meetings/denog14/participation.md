### Health considerations

For on-site participation (workshops, conference and socials) daily COVID testing is required and DENOG will provide a free of charge dedicated on-site testing facility in front of the entrance to the venue. Especially in our field, where many people work on critical infrastructure, we must take responsibility to ensure a safe event.

We encourage participants to wear masks.

The test center onsite is open during the following hours with an estimated time to result of about 10min.
* Sunday, Nov. 13th: 09:30 - 15:30 CET 
* Monday, Nov. 14th: 08:30 - 15:00 CET 
* Tuesday, Nov. 15th: 08:00 - 14:00 CET

The test center uses LumiraDx Antigen Tests which provide a 97.6% positive agreement versus RT-PCR in patients tested within 12 days of the onset of symptoms.

Please note, that we cannot accept any self tests.

## Participate remote

Remote participation is possible via Venueless and requires an state-of-the-art browser as well as a free DENOG online ticket.
