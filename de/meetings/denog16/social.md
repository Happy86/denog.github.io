## DENOG16 - Sunday PreSocial - Blind Peering (self paid) at 7 p.m
Sunday 17th November 2024 around 19.00h CET

We will book tables for around 8 people across Berlin and will assign randomly composed groups. There will be a Table Captain, who is familiar with DENOG. 
If you have registered you will get an email around two days before the event with the name and location of the restaurant, time (around 7 p.m.), name and affiliation of the other members of your group and the contact details of the Table Captain. 
Please make sure to be on time and let us know in advance if you can not join. We made sure to break up usual groups to give you the opportunity to meet new faces. 
Please be advised that the blind peering social is self-paid, so please bring your wallet to pay for your dinner. We reserve the right to charge you the restaurant's cancellation fee if you do not cancel before Saturday or do not show up - but much worse would be very small groups at too large tables who were looking forward to seeing you!

### Deutsches Technik Museum
Deutsches Technik Museum (German Museum of Technology) in Berlin-Kreuzberg is one of the world's leading technology museums. It is located on the historic site of the Gleisdreieck transportation hub and the Anhalter freight station. The raisin bomber (the Douglas C47 “Skytrain”), which was hung on the facade of the new building at the topping-out ceremony in 1999, has become an internationally recognized landmark. Covering 28,500 square meters, it offers an exciting journey of discovery through the cultural history of technology. There are fascinating exhibitions on aviation, shipping, rail transport, the world of technical networking and sugar, automobility, film technology, computer history, chemistry and pharmacy and much more.

Since its opening, the museum has continuously expanded its collection and exhibition space. Many new buildings, areas and exhibitions have been opened over the decades.
Most recently, in 2015, the permanent exhibition “The network. People, cables, data streams” was opened in 2015. With over 500 objects, it provides an insight into the world of technical networking.

## About the foundation
