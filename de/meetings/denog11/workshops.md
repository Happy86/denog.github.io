<h2> Track 1 <h2>
<h3>11:00 - 12:00: PeeringDB - Learning the ropes</h3>
<b>Arnold Nipper</b><br>
PeeringDB is around since more than 15 years now. And PeeringDB 2.0 with
the new GUI and API also already sicne 3.5 years. As documentation is
very sparse we developed a tutorial to explain in detail how to work
with the GUI from registration to management of object.<br>
<b>Prerequirements:</b> bring a unix shell(VM is fine)and basic knowledge on how to use it.<br>
<b>Target Audience:</b> Newcomers

<i>Lunch break: 13:00-14:00 and coffe break 16:00-16:30</i><br>
<b>Wolfgang Tremmel</b><br/>
The Workshop covers the following topics:
<ul>
<li>Networks and Prefixes (IPv6 and IPv4)</li>
<li>What is an Autonmous System and why do I need one?</li>
<li>Interior Routing Protocols Overview (OSPF and IS-IS)</li>
<li>BGP - Border Gateway Protocoll</li>
</ul>
<br>
<b>Prerequirements:</b> Feel comfortable configuiring a router via CLI and bring a laptop<br>
<b>Target Audience:</b> Newcomers

<h2> Track 2 </h2>
<h3>11:00 - 13:30: Linux Routing Basics</h3>
<i>Shorter lunchbreak from 13:30 - 14:00</i><br>
<b>Maximilian Wilhelm</b><br>
Linux has grown into a strong player in the networking world and is used by many even large players around the world for various infrastructure and network purposes.
This workshops will provide an overview on what can be done by &quot;just using Linux boxes and some software&quot;.<br>
The workshop will cover topics like:
<ul>
 <li> Layer 1 &amp; 2 groundwork: Bonding/Channels/LACP, VLANs, Bridges </li>
 <li> Routing tables </li>
 <li> Policy based routing </li>
 <li> VRFs-lite </li>
 <li> Network Namespaces </li>
 <li> OSPF </li>
 <li> BGP </li>
 <li> GRE </li>
 <li> VXLAN </li>
 <li> OpenVPN </li>
 <li> Maybe more, or less, depending on your areas of interest :-) </li>
</ul>
<br>
<b>Prerequirements:</b> Knowledge on Routing, Routing protocols (OSPF, BGP), IPv6, feel comfortable configuring a Linux box via CLI and bring a laptop (with Linux at best) <br>
<b>Target Audience:</b> Network Engineers with a grasp on routing with vendor boxes who want to see what can be done with Linux and how <br>

<h2> Track 3 </h2>
<h3> 12:00 - 13:00: Build 8x100G dark 70km fiber connection </h3>
DIY Workshop to Build a concrete 8x100G DWDM dark fiber link over 70km with:
<ul>
<li> 8 pairs of QSFP28 DWDM Optics </li>
<li> 4 different brands of switches (Juniper/Cisco/Huawei/Arista)</li>
<li> 70km of real fiber </li>
<li> optical measurement and cleaning equipment </li>
</ul>
<br>

<h3> 14:00 - 17:00: BGP Community Framework, Communities & Ansible automation</h3>
<i>Coffe Break 16:00-16:30</i><br>
<b> Peter Sievers, Sebastian Graf </b><br>
In this hands-on workshop the following topics will be covered.
Determine BGP behavior with import- and export policies,
adjust BGP attributes to influence the behavior of the local router
as well as other routers receiving the route.
BGP route manipulation and handling will be shown by using
BGP communities which are associated with a BGP route.

The second part of the workshop will show how to automate the
configuration of network devices using Ansible and Jinja2 templates.

The theory of BGP, Ansible and Automation is presented in a
vendor-neutral way.
The practical configuration examples are shown using Junos
and made available as Hands-on Cli.<br>
<br>
<b>Prerequirements:</b> Laptop with SSH Client, familiarity with Linux Shell, first experiences with BGP and inter domain routing<br/>
<b>Target Audience:</b> Advanced

<h2> Track 4 </h2>
<h3> 14:00 - 16:00: Research and university @ DENOG </h3>
<b> Patrick Bussmann </b><br>
Its been already 2 years since DENOG e.V. has been founded.  As the conference is more and more established and its financial future stabilised and Meetups being kicked of and developed, we would like to open a discussion on how to continue developing our community goals by linking DENOG closer to the Research & University community.
<br><br>
The workshop is a open discussion forum. If you have ideas on projects that we should develop, ideas how to create outreach to the University Community or whom to talk to or if you're generally interested in the developing DENOG further please join the discussion.

<b>Prerequirements:</b> None <br>
<b>Target Audience:</b> Anyone<br>

<h2> Expert Sessions </h2>
<h3> 11:00 - 17:00: Routing Expert Sessions (1h each) </h3>
<b> Theo Voss </b><br>
Are you lost in a BGP problem? Did your network grow to fast and does now require some engineering? Are you unsure how to tackle routing security? Or do you have any other network related problem?

The DENOG expert sessions will put you in touch with an expert who will offer your problem 1h of their time and give their best advice on how they would proceed with it.<br/>
And the best part: It's free!<br/>
<i><b>Please note that you will be assigned a 1h timeslot while they are available</b></i>
<br>
<b>Prerequirements:</b> Try to prepare your questions as detailed as possible and bring supporting material (e.g. network graph) if necessary.<br>
<b>Target Audience:</b> Anyone <br>
