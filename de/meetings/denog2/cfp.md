The second meeting of the German Network Operators Group (DENOG) will be held in Frankfurt, Germany on the 4th of November 2010. We are pleased to hereby invite applications for presentations or lightning talks to be held at this event.

## General Information

DENOG is a community for professionals within Germany who are operating, designing or researching the Internet. It provides a technical forum where those working on, with and for the Internet can come together to solve problems with every aspect of their (net)work. 

The meeting is designed to provide an opportunity for the exchange of information among network operators, engineers, researchers and other professionals close to the network community. 

More information about DENOG (in German) can be found at www2.denog.de Information about the meeting will be published at <http://www.denog.de>

## Topics for Presentations/Talks

The day will be divided into several sessions. The number and length of presentations per session is not fixed, although due to time constraints we would prefer the length of the presentations to be between 10 to 30 minutes. 
However proposals for longer/shorter presentations or presentations whose subject falls outside of the topics below are also welcome; please do not hesitate to submit them.
Lightning Talks

In addition to the topics mentioned below we will reserve slots for lightning talks, which consist of a few slides and will not last longer than 5 minutes. Lightning talks can be submitted until October 29th, with the deadline for submission of the corresponding slides being November 3rd.

### Topic #1: Power Efficiency in Networks

For operators of networks and data centres of any size power efficiency has become more important. Servers and network gear with high power consumption are expensive because of high operating and cooling power costs; also in many places supplying more power into the location is no longer possible. How are you dealing with power problems in your environment? How do you efficiently cool a rack/a room/a datacenter? Can a migration to VoIP help you save power?

### Topic #2: Social Networks, Cloud Services and Information Security

Social Networks are an essential working tool for networkers and cloud services are also becoming increasingly popular. The security of your information and data in these networks is a crucial aspect which we want to discuss in this session.

### Topic #3: Network Neutrality

In the US, Network Neutrality has been a subject of controversy and debate. Is an ISP allowed to sell "Internet access" which only offers access to a subset of the whole Internet? Is an ISP allowed to prioritise video streams from Company A while imposing a higher delay to video streams from Company B?
In Germany Network Neutrality is mainly an issue for mobile networks and not extensively discussed thus far. But what kind of problems will an upcoming debate on Network Neutrality bring to German ISPs and is there a good way to address these problems?

### Topic #4: Peering

Everything about your peering experience. Why are you doing it? How are you doing it? Have you written any useful tools which others might find interesting?

### Topic #5: ISP BOF

"All things ISP". From Network/SLA Management (for or against it), abuse handling and log systems to data centre layout and planning (including power and cooling), everything that is interesting to you as an ISP can be presented or discussed within this topic.
Language of Slides and Talks

To appeal to an international audience we ask you to produce your slides in English, but the spoken language of the presentation itself can be either German or English.

## Submission Guidelines

All submissions must have a strong technical bias and must not be solely promotional for your employer. 

Please remember that your presentations should be suitable for a target audience of technicians from varied backgrounds, working for companies whose sizes may vary considerably. 

To submit a proposal for a presentation, we request that you provide the following information as plain text or PDF format to [denog-pc@denog.de](mailto:denog-pc@denog.de):

- the name of the presenter (and if applicable your affiliation)
- a working email address
- the name and number of the topic which will contain the presentation
- the title of the presentation
- its expected length (in minutes)
- the preferred spoken language for the presentation
- a short abstract of the presentation (not more than 200 words)

We also welcome suggestions for specific presentations which you feel would be valuable to the DENOG community. Please be aware that your presentation will be published on the DENOG website after the event.
