## GENERAL INFORMATION

DENOG is a community for professionals within Germany who are operating, designing or researching the Internet. It provides a technical forum where those working on, with and for the Internet can come together to solve problems with every aspect of their (net)work.

The meeting is designed to provide an opportunity for the exchange of information among network operators, engineers, researchers and other professionals close to the network community.

## TOPICS FOR PRESENTATIONS/TALKS

The day will be divided into several sessions. The number and length of presentations per session is not fixed, although due to time constraints we would prefer the length of the presentations to be between 15 to 30 minutes.

However proposals whose subject fall outside of the topics below are also welcome; please do not hesitate to submit them.

### Topic #1: Security / Global internet infrastructure

Cyber attacks, software bugs, route-hijacking incidents and denial of service attacks are common in todays internet, not only affecting single companies, carriers or enterprises but sometimes even entire countries. In this light securing the global internet infrastructure is a major topic amongst entities relying on the internet.
Individual systems can be essential for the global internet infrastructure. What kind of mechanisms are available to secure our own infrastructure today? How can we secure a globally relevant security system e.g. for RPKI or DNSSec?

### Topic #2: Mobile connectivity

Mobile networks are still growing substantially, both in the number of new users and traffic. Recently LTE became the latest trend in mobile broadband technology and is already rolled out in some regions of Germany. What are the requirements for LTE and similar technologies for the carrier networks and interconnects to other networks? Is there a special approach for CDNs to handle the growing demand from mobile users?

### Topic #3: Peering

Everything about your peering experience. Why are you doing it? How are you doing it? Have you written any useful tools which others might find interesting? What are the issues you are facing?

### Topic #4: World IPv6 Launch

World IPv6 Launch took place on 06.06.2012. Has the internet, and especially the IPv6 world, been changing since this day? Have large/leading ISPs in Germany been implementing IPv6 successfully? What difficulties did they approach and how did they overcome those?

### Topic #5: ISP BOF

"All things ISP". From Network/SLA Management (for or against it), abuse handling and log systems to data centre layout and planning (including power and cooling), everything that is interesting to you as an ISP can be presented or discussed within this topic.

### Lightning Talks

In addition to the topics mentioned below we will reserve slots for lightning talks, which consist of a few slides and will not last longer than 5 minutes. Lightning talks can be submitted until November 8th, with the deadline for submission of the corresponding slides being November 14th.

## LANGUAGE OF SLIDES AND TALKS

To appeal to an international audience we ask you to produce your slides in English, but the spoken language of the presentation itself can be either German or English.

## SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

All submissions must have a strong technical bias and must not be solely promotional for your employer.

Please remember that your presentations should be suitable for a target audience of technicians from varied backgrounds, working for companies whose sizes may vary considerably.

To submit a proposal for a presentation, we request you to register. If you have further questions, you can reach the program commitee at [denog-pc@denog.de](mailto:denog-pc@denog.de).

We also welcome suggestions for specific presentations which you feel would be valuable to the DENOG community.

Please be aware that your presentation and a video of it will be published on the DENOG website after the event.
