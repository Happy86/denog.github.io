# Event Support

Go to the #InfoPoint Chat in Venueless or email event@denog.de
If you are participating on-site do not hesitate to reach out to our Info Point, which will be staffed during the whole event.

If, during any time at the event - either remote or in person, you feel unwell, unsafe, threatened, etc. please do not hesitate to approach anyone of board members or contact us via vorstand@denog.de


# Helping at the event (aka. be an angel)

Would you like to be an angel and help with DENOG15? Want to contribute with your skill and strength, meet other people, have a look behind the scene, just help out? For most of the roles you don’t need any specific experience and you will learn everything you need for the job in our briefings on-site.

If you like to contribute, please register in the engel system (see below). 


## Registration for Angel

We have decided to use the angel system that the CCC also uses for its congress. This means that the system may look quite familiar to you.

Please register at <a href="https://engel.denog.de">https://engel.denog.de</a> and indicate your availability by signing up as 'Availability Indication Angel ("here I have time")' in the 'Availability Indication Shift ("here I have time")'. We ask you to include your real name, email address and phone number so that we can recognize and reach you. We will then group you into the different shifts and roles. There will be an onsite briefing of all Angels every morning and additionally appropriate to the role. If you’re attending online only, you can volunteer to help in venueless.

If you have any questions, please contact us at <a href="event@denog.de">event@denog.de</a>.


## Description of different Angel roles

In the following we’d like to describe the different roles throughout the event, so that you can get an idea about the different takes.

Next to the Info Point and in the process of check-in the next station will be the Attendee Wall. We’ll shoot an instant photo of every attendee and pin it to a big pin board.

Tasks:
- Make an instant photo of every new attendee
- Pin it to the wall and stick a sticker with the attendee's details underneath.

The Photo & Social Media Angel will be in the Auditorium and walks around to make the conference visible on social media.

Tasks:
