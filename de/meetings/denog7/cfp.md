The seventh meeting of the German Network Operators Group (DENOG) will be held in Darmstadt, Germany on the 29th and 30th of October 2015. We are pleased to hereby invite applications for presentations or lightning talks to be held at this event.

## General Information

DENOG is a community for professionals within Germany who are operating, designing or researching the Internet. It provides a technical forum where those working on, with and for the Internet can come together to solve problems with every aspect of their (net)work.

The meeting is designed to provide an opportunity for the exchange of information among network operators, engineers, researchers and other professionals close to the network community.

## Topics for Presentations/Talks

The DENOG Programme Committee is seeking presentation proposals from the community for the meeting days. The meeting will have one single track of presentations which number and length are not fixed, although due to time constraints we would prefer the length of the presentations to be between 15 and 30 minutes. We will also reserve slots for lightning talks, which consist of a few slides and will not last longer than 10 minutes.

DENOG meetings are very network centric and we are looking for presentations covering topics of network engineering and operation. These topics could be:

- Network and resource planning
- Data centre technologies
- Network and routing security
- Internet peering
- IPv6 deployment
- Network operations

## Language of Slides and Talks

To appeal to an international audience we ask you to produce your slides in English, but the spoken language of the presentation itself can be either German or English.

## Submission Guidelines

All submissions must have a strong technical bias and must not be solely promotional for your employer. We strongly discourage product marketing talks.

Please remember that your presentations should be suitable for a target audience of technicians from varied backgrounds, working for companies whose sizes may vary considerably.

To submit a proposal for a presentation, we request that you provide the following information as plain text or PDF format to pc@meeting.denog.de:

- the name of the presenter (and if applicable your affiliation)
- a working email address
- the title of the presentation
- its expected length (in minutes)
- the preferred spoken language for the presentation
- a short abstract of the presentation (not more than 200 words)

We will collect all submissions until the deadline for submissions and then will collectively vote on all submissions. You will receive feedback once the final decision has been made.

We also welcome suggestions for specific presentations which you feel would be valuable to the DENOG community.

Please be aware that your presentation and possibly a video of it will be published on the DENOG website after the event.

If you have any questions or requests concerning presentation submissions please send mail to [pc@meeting.denog.de](mailto:pc@meeting.denog.de)
