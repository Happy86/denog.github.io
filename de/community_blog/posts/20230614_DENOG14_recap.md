Many thanks to the entire orga-team for organizing throughout the year a conference of three wonderful days in Hamburg with workshops and talks! Many thanks to the speakers and organizers of the workshops, the many angels who made the smooth process possible. Thank you Anita Meyer, Patrick Bussmann and <a href="https://www.nilssamp.com">Nils Samp</a> with all interview partners for creating this great video - emotions come up and I'm looking forward to the next DENOG event!
And last but not least, thank you for attending the conference - onsite or virtually - and for your interest in DENOG.
