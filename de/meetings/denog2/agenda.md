### "Native IPv6 via xDSL - how to tweak your LNS" - Fredy Künzler, Init7

[back to agenda](#top)

### "RIPE Labs - Operators Tools, Ideas and Analysis" - Mirjam Kuehne

RIPE Labs is a platform designed by the RIPE NCC for network operators, developers and industry experts to expose, test and discuss innovative Internet-related tools, ideas and analysis that can benefit the RIPE community and the broader technology world. Anyone can:

- Present research
- Showcase prototype tools
- Share operational experience
- Exchange ideas
- Discuss with others in the community

You can find articles related to a wide range of operational topics, for instance routing, DNSSEC, IPv6, operators tools, measurements and statistics. Under each article there is space to contribute feedback on prototypes, suggest improvements and discuss news, ideas and developments.

### "Presentation and Panel Discussion Network Neutrality"

In the US, Network Neutrality has been a subject of controversy and debate. Is an ISP allowed to sell "Internet access" which only offers access to a subset of the whole Internet? Is an ISP allowed to prioritise video streams from Company A while imposing a higher delay to video streams from Company B? In Germany Network Neutrality is mainly an issue for mobile networks and not extensively discussed thus far. But what kind of problems will an upcoming debate on Network Neutrality bring to German ISPs and is there a good way to address these problems?

### "RANCID on speed - Salvation for Network Operators" - Marcus Stögbauer

RANCID is used in many places to save the configuration of various network devices. A lot of people also like to use the login scripts to log into their devices without typing a password every time. But once you have the configuration stored on your hard disk there is a lot more you can do with it. 
In this talk I will present a variety of scripts and tools which we wrote over the course of time that make use of the saved configuration files or RANCID tools to ease the life of network operators.

### "An optics life - predict the D-day with the help of RANCID" - Thomas Weible

Day by day there are more 10G links deployed in all kind of core networks - either enterprise or the internet. Those links have in common that they have to be reliable. The higher the data rate of each single link, the more sessions are included. If one of these links fail because of a transceiver failure the sessions are dropped in most circumstances (e.g. in link aggregation) for a short period. 

The goal of the project "An optics life" is, to predict the time when a transceiver will reach its real end-of-life-time based on the actual setup in the datacenter / colocation. Our assumption is, that when combining and finding correlations between the operation time, type of transceiver (LR, DWDM, CWDM), temperature, RX power, TX power, consumed current and provided voltage of the host system there is a chance to predict the D-day. This is not proven yet but that is the challenge. Packed with this information a network engineer can perform a replacement in a maintenance window and keeps the spare part costs on a low level. But the most important fact is the elimination of a potential risk which could cause nightmares for any network operator. 

The project "an optics life" started in September 2010. The first contribution members are Flexoptix, DE-CIX, MANDA and hostserver. The project members will provide a framework to easily contribute to this project for each single network operator. Our first work on the framework will be presented at DENOG2 so that new members get an idea how easy it will be to contribute to the project. Marcus will present the implementation on the basis of RANCID. Keep in mind that we are also opened for other approaches to get the job done. Hopefully there will be an valuable discussion at DENOG2. 

Project Timeline: The framework will be published within the year 2010. The analysis of the transceiver data will start in mid 2011. First results might be available at the end of 2011. The project coordination is done by Thomas Weible – anopticslife@flexoptix.net

### "The German Internet Infrastructure: Exposure and Monitoring" - Thomas C. Schmidt

The Internet was originally shaped to offer transmission services to those who were willing to inter-connect. Its scalable architecture aimed at supporting a global information infrastructure without contributions at a national level, nor governmental support. Meanwhile the Internet has matured to a mission-critical infrastructure for enabling key operations of public administration and business affairs, of research, education, and entertainment within individual countries.
In this presentation, we first identify, characterize and visualize the fraction of the Internet that serves as the nation-centric communication system of Germany. Starting from the RIPE database and harvesting several additional databases, route monitors and Internet measurement projects, we extract the minimal routing graph that interconnects all members, as well as a subset of relevant players within the German Internet. This characterization has been obtained fully automatic by a chain of retrieval and refinement tools. It thus can be exploited to build an online monitoring system for performing fault and performance management of the national routing system. First concepts for such a German routing information system are discussed, as well.
