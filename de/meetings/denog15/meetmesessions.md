# Meet Me Sessions

On this page we want to give you some help for the meet me sessions. 

We’d like to thank our friends at <a href="https://nix.cz">nix.cz</a> warmly for making the <a href="https://nix.cz/en/meet">“Meet”</a> tool available to us!


## Registration 

We transfer you information from your ticket (pretix) to Meet - a tool for bilateral meetings made by nix.cz. You will get an invite email, looking like this:

Click on the link, set a password and you're logged in. 

You name, company, ASN, IRC nickname and pronoun are copied from you ticket information (pretix). 

Even if you don't want to do a Meet Me Session, please sign up once and just click away the availability. This can be done be unchecking the blue buttons as shown here. The lines with blue background are the whole days, the other lines are the single time slots:

If you wan to participate, you might want to upload a photo to your profile. Click on your name in the upper right corner and you will find this: 

<img width="300px" src="/images/meetings/denog15/meet-settings.png" />

Here you can set the dark mode theme and prevent Meet from making sounds for new meetings or comments. Also there is the way to you profile. 

In the Profile you can change some details (title, pronoun/suffix, nickname), upload a photo or set colors. You also can choose if you want Meet to send you emails for nre Meetings or Comments. There is also the change password button. 

Beside these general settings there are some event ("DENOG15 Meet Me Sessions") specific settings. These can be found here: 

<img width="300px" src="/images/meetings/denog15/meet-event-settings.png" /><br /><br />
<img width="500px" src="/images/meetings/denog15/meet-event-settings2.png" />

You can download all you meetings as iCal. Or change to view to see also the rejected or canceled meetings. 

Last but not least you might want to schedule a meeting. Click in the button "Invite" and find this window: 

<img width="500px" src="/images/meetings/denog15/meet-meeting-invite.png" />

This is pretty forward: search for attendees you want to meet, ad a subject and description, find a time slot and you can confirm. 
If you have a look at the last line, you can uncheck "Automatically select meeting location" and then check "Add custom" to write a custom location name like "barista" or "Hotel Lobby" if you don't want to sit at the possibly mundane meet me tables ;-) 

That's it.
