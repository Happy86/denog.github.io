## Remote Venue

The remote location is, again, Venueless. You don’t need to install any app, it runs completely in your browser. By experience we recommend to use Chrome but it will work in any other browsers as well. 

After your <a href="tickets.html">registration</a> for DENOG15 you received a confirmation eMail (Subject Line: [DENOG15] Your order ...) including a link to your order. Please open the link and click on "Join online event" at the very top. This link and venueless will be open on Sunday, 10.00h CET. 

If you can't join or can't find your link please visit [https://pretix.eu/denog/denog15/](https://pretix.eu/denog/denog15/) and use the "resend order links". Otherwise reach out to event@denog.de 

Remote tickets will be available until the end of the conference. On popular request we have kept the option to receive the event t-shirt as a remote attendee but ask for €10.00 contribution to cover portion of the cost. On-site are limited due to space constraints and might run out.
