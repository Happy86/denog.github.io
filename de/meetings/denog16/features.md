# On-site Features


## Attendee Wall
Are you on-site and looking for someone you haven’t met in person before? Then take a look at our attendee wall! After check-in, we’ll offer anyone to take an instant photo and post it on the attendee wall, right next to the Info Desk. This gives everyone an opportunity to see  who is already on site and add a face to the name. If you wish you can directly schedule a "meet me session" and get to know each other!


## MeetMe-Sessions
Would you like to introduce yourself or get to know someone? Maybe you've got a short topic to sync-up on? Let me introduce you to the MeetMe-Sessions!

We blocked two periods during the conference days Monday and Tuesday. These are during the lunch breaks - this year lunch will be served longer and the same time as the MeetMe-Sessions. During these periods you have some slots of each 15 minutes plus a 5 minute break. So enough time to introduce yourself, but probably not for a full conversation or contract negotiation.

In the tool "Meet" you can set up a profile and indicate if you are not available during time slots. It’s okay to decline a Meet request or not to offer "MeetMe-Sessions" at all. For the latter, we’d like to ask you to then unset your availability in "Meet". We hope to give you a good opportunity to get in touch with others!

We will send every on-site participant access to the "Meet" tool in the coming days along with more detailed instructions. 

We’d like to thank our friends at <a href="https://nix.cz">nix.cz</a> warmly for making the “Meet” tool available to us!

<b>More information about the "Meet" tool and helpful steps can be found here: <a href="meetmesessions.html">MeetMe-Sessions</a>.</b>


## Job Board
You attend DENOG16, the largest network operator conference in Germany, and it comes to your mind that someone in the crowd could be a match for one of your open job offers? That’s a brilliant idea! DENOG is offering a job board for the first time this year! 

It’s easy to participate: Design a printable page for each job offer (up to 3) and send it as a PDF by November 8th to job-board@denog.de - that’s it! We will present it at the job board on site as well as in venueless for the online attendees throughout the entire event. 

We’d like to have your name on the job offer to make it possible for other attendees getting in touch with you and/or your company during DENOG16! You are welcome to be creative and add your photo as well to make it even easier for interested attendees to find their potential job offer match.

Rules: 
- One DIN A4 page in portrait format per job offer
- Max. 3 job offers per company and/or attendee (no spam please!)
- Name of on site attendee as locale contact must be included in every job offer
- Send job offer(s) in PDF format to <a href="mailto:job-board@denog.de">job-board@denog.de</a>
- Deadline for submission: Wednesday, November 8th 2024 11:59 pm 
- DENOG will print the PDFs and hang them on the job board (pin boards) and also make them available to the online attendees in venueless
- Please be aware, that we cannot accept any job offers printed by yourself or any other self service at the pin boards


<!--
## Workspace quiet & Workspace loud
The Workspaces are dedicated rooms to work. You can choose between the room "workspace quiet" and the room "workspace loud". In the "workspace quiet" we ask everyone to be - quiet! Here you can write your emails or do whatever work without being interrupted by noise. In the "workspace loud" talking is allowed.

Both workspaces are equipped with chairs, tables, power (EU plug) and wifi.

## Community Sticker Exchange
The Community Sticker Exchange is the place to exchange your beloved stickers! If you wish, bring your own stickers to the exchange. The deliverer is responsible for the stickers.
