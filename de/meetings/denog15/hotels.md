<b>If the hotel refers to a booking via website, please insist on the e-mail booking, as this was explicitly requested by the hotel in the first place. An online booking via the hotel website is NOT possible, the code is not accepted there or returns the wrong rates!
Please check the confirmation, you may have to fill out and send back a form.</b> 

Standard single room: 123,00€ room/night, incl. breakfast with a value of 25€/person
Standard double room: 160,00€ room/night, incl. breakfast with a value of 25€/person

The rooms are booked and paid for by the guests directly at the hotel. The prices include service and the legally valid value-added tax. (Mehrwertsteuer) 

Room reservations can be canceled or shortened free of charge up to 4 weeks before arrival. In case of later cancellation, shortening of stay, or non-arrival (no-show), the hotel is entitled to charge cancellation fees of 80% of the agreed room rate.

Note: There is an accommodation tax by the city of Berlin since January 1st, 2014. The accommodation tax amounts to 5% of the net overnight rate. (+ VAT) Only private overnight stays are taxed, limited to a consecutive overnight stay of 21 days. Business trips are exempt from the accommodation tax.

## Sustainability - transportation and accommodations 

DENOG15 in Berlin will be held in the Estrel Congress Center (Sonnenallee 225, 12057 Berlin). 

We are committed to holding a sustainable conference. We will gradually announce various information about this. For today, please consider sustainable aspects when planning your trip. For arrival with public transport you can use the “Deutschlandticket” (https://deutschlandticket.de/) and the event ticket for the Estrel Hotel (https://www.estrel.com/en/congress/services -> scroll down to "Event Ticket with Deutsche Bahn"). 

Your accommodation could be operated sustainably, for example with renewable energy. Ideally, it should be within walking distance of the venue. For the pre-social and social event, we will make sure that these locations are within walking distance or can be reached by public transport.
