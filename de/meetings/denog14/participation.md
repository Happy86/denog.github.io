### Health considerations

For on-site participation (workshops, conference and socials) daily COVID testing is required and DENOG will provide a free of charge dedicated on-site testing facility in front of the entrance to the venue. Especially in our field, where many people work on critical infrastructure, we must take responsibility to ensure a safe event.

We encourage participants to wear masks.

For the opening hours of our testing center - please refer to our '[About](https://www.denog.de/de/meetings/denog14/#hygiene-concept)' page and the 'Hygiene Concept' section.

Please note, that we cannot accept any self tests.

## Participate remote

Remote participation is possible via Venueless and requires an state-of-the-art browser as well as a free DENOG online ticket.

For further information on Venueless and how-to use it, please refer to our venueless introduction from our last virtual DENOG event.
