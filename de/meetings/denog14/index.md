# Hygiene Concept

DENOG14 is our first in-person conference since the start of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Especially in our field, where many people work on critical infrastructure, we must take responsibility to ensure a safe event.

We will provide rapid testing infrastructure. Daily testing is mandatory to enter the event location.
We encourage participants to wear masks.

Safety measures will be adjusted to the current situation and government regulation.
