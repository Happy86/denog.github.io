## Conference Hotel & Reservation

We have reserved a contingent for DENOG15 attendees at a special rate at the Estrel Berlin and are committed to taking these. The special rate can be booked by emailing reservierung@estrel.com using the code "DENOG 15". The code is valid until October 8th, 2023.

<b>If the hotel refers to a booking via website, please insist on the e-mail booking, as this was explicitly requested by the hotel in the first place. An online booking via the hotel website is NOT possible, the code is not accepted there or returns the wrong rates!</b>

Standard single room: 123,00€ room/night, incl. breakfast with a value of 25€/person
Standard double room: 160,00€ room/night, incl. breakfast with a value of 25€/person

The rooms are booked and paid for by the guests directly at the hotel. The prices include service and the legally valid value-added tax. (Mehrwertsteuer) 

Room reservations can be canceled or shortened free of charge up to 4 weeks before arrival. In case of later cancellation, shortening of stay, or non-arrival (no-show), the hotel is entitled to charge cancellation fees of 80% of the agreed room rate.

Note: There is an accommodation tax by the city of Berlin since January 1st, 2014. The accommodation tax amounts to 5% of the net overnight rate. (+ VAT) Only private overnight stays are taxed, limited to a consecutive overnight stay of 21 days. Business trips are exempt from the accommodation tax. 

If you attend DENOG 15 for business, please bring an employer's confirmation for your safety. In your room reservation email, state that you are traveling for business. More information and the confirmation document/form can be found at:
