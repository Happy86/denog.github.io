## "SDN Reality Check" - Carsten Michel, Xantaro

Software Defined Networking (SDN) has become a new hype these days and surprisingly there seems to be a lack of definition and a lot of confusion about the real benfeits. This presentation describes the overall concept of SDN and provides an overview of the technology that is available today. In addition, use cases which are applicable to the data center are discussed.

## "How to explore EDNS-Client-Subnet Supporters in your Free Time" - Florian Streibelt

In this talk we show how the EDNS Client-Subnet Extension (ECS) offers unique but likely unintended opportunities to uncover details about the supporting companies' operational practices at almost no cost. A key observation is, that ECS allows everyone to resolve domain names of ECS supporters on behalf of any arbitrary IP/prefix in the Internet and thus map the distribution of end-users to CDN-servers.

## "Network Functions Virtualization on top of Xen" - Simon Kuenzer, NEC Laboratories Europe

Middleboxes are both crucial to today’s networks and ubiquitous, but embed knowledge of today’s protocols and applications to the detriment of those of tomorrow, making the network harder to evolve. SDNs seek to make it easier to extend the network with new functionality, but most of the research effort has focused on the network’s control plane, that is, how packets are switched are routed through a SDN. Given the pervasiveness and importance of middleboxes, we believe that a fully programmable network should also be able to dynamically instantiate and quickly move middlebox functionality. In this lecture we shift focus towards making the data plane more programmable by introducing ClickOS, a tiny, Xen-based virtual machine that can run a wide range of middleboxes. ClickOS is small (5MB when running), can be instantiated in very small times (roughly 30 milliseconds) and can fill up a 10Gb pipe while concurrently running 128 VMs on a low-cost commodity server.

## "Technical aspects of Internet Governance" - Marco Hogewoning, RIPE NCC

The Internet, long managed and cherished by the technical community, has turned itself in the 4th utility. It has become a fundamental supporting structure for today's economy and society. This in turn raises concerns in both public and private sectors about security, stability and sustainability of the Internet. "Internet Governance" has become the overall term for discussions about these topics. In this talk we will introduce some of the institutions that play a role in Internet Governance and some of the meetings and fora where these discussions happen.
Next to that we will highlight some of the topics that could have impact on the technical space and influence the day to day work of system and network administrators. We will show some of the contributions made by the RIPE NCC and explain how system administrators on a local and national level can help by providing input in these discussions.

## "100Gbps in Metro Networks" - Sven Krüger, Cube Optics

Fired by bandwidth hungry applications of enterprises and end-users data rate demand is still growing at ca. 45% CAGR. Not only does this increase data traffic within data centers but also in metro range networks. Already in 2008 the IEEE task force started to standardize 100Gbps interfaces for shorter reach application, in parallel to ITU based long-haul transmission. Now, 5y later the technology matures. 100G metro range transport has now become possible by passive means, based on pluggable 100G optics and avoiding the implementation of complex and costly transport systems and unnecessary media conversion. This enables 100Gbps metro range networks to become attractive not only for the “early adaptors” but also in terms of cost and port density.
