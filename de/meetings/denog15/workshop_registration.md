<h1>Workshop Registration</h1><br>

The workshop day of the DENOG15 conference takes place on Sunday the 19th of November 2023 in Berlin.
Please register if you want to attend a workshop, as we have a limited number of seats.
If a workshop is full, you can join the waiting list. When a seat frees up, you will get an email and need to acknowledge that you want to take that seat.

<b>To attend a workshop you need a ticket for the main DENOG15 on-site event!</b> <a href="tickets.html">Conference Ticket Shop</a> - <u>We will cancel your workshop ticket if we cannot find a corresponding DENOG15 on-site ticket!</u>

More information about the workshops can be found in our <a href="agenda.html">Agenda</a>.

If you have any questions, please reach out to event (at) denog.de
